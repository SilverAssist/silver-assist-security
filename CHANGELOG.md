## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-06

### Overview

Silver Assist Security Essentials v1.1.1 is the first stable and fully functional release of our comprehensive WordPress security plugin. This plugin addresses three critical security vulnerabilities commonly found in WordPress security audits with modern PHP 8+ architecture, centralized configuration management, and robust GraphQL protection.

### Architecture & Configuration

#### Centralized Configuration System
- **DefaultConfig Class**: Single source of truth for all plugin settings with two-tier configuration approach
- **GraphQLConfigManager**: Singleton pattern for centralized GraphQL configuration management with intelligent caching
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced configuration overhead through centralized caching and unified option handling
- **Configuration Consistency**: Eliminated duplicate configuration logic across all components

#### Modern PHP 8+ Implementation
- **PSR-4 Autoloading**: Organized namespace structure (`SilverAssist\Security\{ComponentType}\{ClassName}`)
- **Strict Type Declarations**: Full PHP 8+ type safety with union types and match expressions
- **WordPress Function Integration**: Proper `\` prefixes for all WordPress functions in namespaced contexts
- **Use Statement Standards**: Alphabetical sorting and same-namespace exclusion rules across all PHP files
- **String Consistency**: Modern string interpolation patterns and double quote consistency throughout codebase
- **Singleton Patterns**: Efficient resource management and configuration centralization

### Core Security Features

#### WordPress Admin Login Protection
- **Brute Force Protection**: Configurable IP-based login attempt limiting (1-20 attempts)
