# Silver Assist Security Essentials

A comprehensive WordPress security plugin designed to resolve critical security vulnerabilities identified in security assessments, specifically targeting login protection, HTTPOnly cookie implementation, and GraphQL security misconfigurations.

## 🛡️ Overview

**Silver Assist Security Essentials** addresses three critical security vulnerabilities commonly found in WordPress security audits:

1. **WordPress Admin Login Page Exposure** - Protects against brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts
2. **Missing HTTPOnly Flag on Cookies** - Prevents XSS attacks from accessing authentication cookies  
3. **GraphQL Security Misconfigurations** - Comprehensive protection against DoS attacks, introspection abuse, and resource exhaustion

This plugin automatically implements enterprise-level security measures without requiring technical knowledge, making it perfect for WordPress sites that need to pass security audits and compliance requirements.

## 🎯 Security Issues Resolved

### 🔐 WordPress Admin Login Page Security
**Problem**: Publicly accessible login page vulnerable to brute force attacks, user enumeration, bot crawling  
**Solution**: 
- IP-based login attempt limiting (configurable 1-20 attempts)
- Session timeout management (5-120 minutes)
- User enumeration protection via login error standardization
- Strong password enforcement (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Bot and Crawler Protection**: Automatic blocking of suspicious crawlers, scanners, and automated tools
- **Anti-Reconnaissance**: Blocks security scanning tools (Nmap, Nikto, WPScan, Nuclei, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid-fire login attempts from automated scripts

### 🍪 HTTPOnly Cookie Flag Missing
**Problem**: Cookies accessible to client-side JavaScript, vulnerable to XSS attacks  
**Solution**:
- Automatic HTTPOnly flag implementation for all WordPress authentication cookies
- Secure cookie configuration for HTTPS sites
- SameSite protection against CSRF attacks
- Session cookie security enhancement

### 🛡️ GraphQL Security Misconfigurations
**Problem**: Multiple GraphQL vulnerabilities including introspection exposure, unlimited aliases, field duplication, and circular queries  
**Solution**:
- **Introspection Blocking**: Disabled in production environments
- **Query Depth Limits**: Configurable limits (1-20 levels, default: 8) 
- **Query Complexity Control**: Prevents resource exhaustion (10-1000 points, default: 100)
- **Query Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts (1-30 seconds, default: 5)
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests per minute per IP to prevent DoS attacks
- **Alias & Field Duplication Protection**: Prevents excessive aliases and field repetition
