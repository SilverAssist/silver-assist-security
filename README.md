# Silver Assist Security Essentials

A comprehensive WordPress security plugin designed to resolve critical security vulnerabilities identified in security assessments, specifically targeting admin protection (login security & URL hiding), HTTPOnly cookie implementation, and GraphQL security misconfigurations.

## 🛡️ Overview

**Silver Assist Security Essentials** addresses three critical security vulnerabilities commonly found in WordPress security audits:

1. **WordPress Admin Protection & Access Control** - Comprehensive protection against brute force attacks, unauthorized access, and admin discovery
2. **Missing HTTPOnly Flag on Cookies** - Prevents XSS attacks from accessing authentication cookies  
3. **GraphQL Security Misconfigurations** - Comprehensive protection against DoS attacks, introspection abuse, and resource exhaustion

This plugin automatically implements enterprise-level security measures without requiring technical knowledge, making it perfect for WordPress sites that need to pass security audits and compliance requirements.

## 🎯 Security Issues Resolved

### 🔐 WordPress Admin Protection & Access Control

**Problem**: Publicly accessible admin area vulnerable to brute force attacks, user enumeration, bot crawling, and automated discovery
**Solution**:

- **Login Protection**: IP-based login attempt limiting (configurable 1-20 attempts)
- **Session Management**: Session timeout management (5-120 minutes) with enforced session cookie lifetime
- **CAPTCHA Security Challenge**: Math-based CAPTCHA on login page during Under Attack Mode to block automated login attempts
- **Remember Me Removal**: "Remember Me" checkbox removed from login form to enforce strict session timeout policies
- **User Enumeration Protection**: Login error standardization prevents user discovery
- **Strong Password Enforcement**: Mandatory complex passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Bot and Crawler Protection**: Automatic blocking of suspicious crawlers, scanners, and automated tools
- **Anti-Reconnaissance**: Blocks security scanning tools (Nmap, Nikto, WPScan, Nuclei, etc.)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid-fire login attempts from automated scripts
- **Custom Admin URLs**: Configure personalized admin access paths (e.g., `/my-secure-admin`)
- **404 Redirect Protection**: Direct access to standard admin URLs returns 404 errors to hide admin existence
- **Real-Time Path Validation**: Live feedback while typing custom paths with security keyword filtering
- **Intelligent Path Blocking**: Prevents use of obvious paths like 'admin', 'login', 'dashboard', 'wp-admin'

### 🍪 HTTPOnly Cookie Flag Missing

**Problem**: Cookies accessible to client-side JavaScript, vulnerable to XSS attacks  
**Solution**:

- Automatic HTTPOnly flag implementation for all WordPress authentication cookies
- Secure cookie configuration for HTTPS sites
- SameSite protection against CSRF attacks
- Session cookie security enhancement

### 🛡️ GraphQL Security Misconfigurations

**Problem**: Multiple GraphQL vulnerabilities including introspection exposure, unlimited aliases, field duplication, and circular queries  
**Solution**:

- **Introspection Blocking**: Disabled in production environments
- **Query Depth Limits**: Configurable limits (1-20 levels, default: 8)
- **Query Complexity Control**: Prevents resource exhaustion (10-1000 points, default: 100)
- **Query Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts (1-30 seconds, default: 5)
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 requests per minute per IP to prevent DoS attacks
- **Alias & Field Duplication Protection**: Prevents excessive aliases and field repetition

### 📧 Contact Form 7 Integration & Form Protection

**Problem**: Contact forms vulnerable to spam, bot abuse, and resource exhaustion attacks  
**Solution**:

- **Automatic Integration**: Seamless integration with Contact Form 7 when plugin is active
- **CAPTCHA on Forms**: Math-based CAPTCHA challenge injected into CF7 forms during Under Attack Mode
- **Form Submission Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid-fire spam submissions per IP
- **Bot Protection**: Advanced detection of automated form submission attempts
- **IP-based Blocking**: Temporary blocks for IPs exceeding submission limits
- **CSRF Protection**: Enhanced nonce validation for form security

define('SILVER_ASSIST_HIDE_ADMIN', false);
```

**Step 4**: Save the file and refresh your website  
**Step 5**: You can now access admin at the standard `/wp-admin` URL  
**Step 6**: After regaining access, you can reconfigure the admin path and remove the constant

## ⚠️ System Requirements & Notes

**System Requirements**

- **WordPress**: 6.5 or higher
- **PHP**: 8.2 or higher
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for full security features

**Important Notes**

- Always backup your website before installing security plugins
- Currently optimized for single WordPress installations
- Multisite compatibility coming in future versions

## 🧪 Development & Testing

### Quality Assurance Script

Run comprehensive quality checks matching CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# Run all checks (PHPStan, PHPCS, PHPUnit)
./scripts/run-quality-checks.sh

# Run only WordPress tests (real environment)
./scripts/run-quality-checks.sh --skip-phpstan --skip-phpcs

# Run only type checking
./scripts/run-quality-checks.sh --skip-tests
```

### Testing Strategy for Security Plugin

**🔒 CRITICAL**: This is a security plugin - testing requires real WordPress environment.

#### Two-Stage Testing Approach

**1. PHPStan (Static Analysis - Standalone)**

- Validates PHP type safety WITHOUT WordPress
- Fast static analysis (30 seconds)
- Catches type errors before running tests
- Configuration: `phpstan.neon` (Level 8)

**2. PHPUnit (Integration Testing - WordPress Environment)**

- Validates security features in REAL WordPress with MySQL
- Tests actual login protection, cookie security, GraphQL limits
- **CRITICAL** for security plugin validation
- Configuration: `phpunit.xml.dist`

#### Local Testing Setup

```bash
# One-time: Install WordPress Test Suite
./scripts/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest

# Daily: Run quality checks before committing
./scripts/run-quality-checks.sh
```

#### Why Both Tests Are Required

**PHPStan alone ❌**: Cannot validate WordPress hooks, database operations, or security features  
**PHPUnit alone ❌**: Doesn't catch type errors early  
**Both together ✅**: Complete validation - type safety + real security testing

#### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 350+ tests across all security components
- **Integration Tests**: 50+ tests for WordPress environment
- **Security Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of login, cookies, GraphQL, CAPTCHA
- **CI/CD Matrix**: 12 environment combinations (PHP 8.0-8.2 × WordPress 6.5-latest)

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**

*GraphQL not working after activation?*

- Verify WPGraphQL plugin is installed and active
- Check GraphQL query complexity limits in settings

*Website seems slower?*

- Adjust GraphQL query limits if needed

*Tests failing locally?*

- Ensure WordPress Test Suite is installed: `./scripts/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest`
